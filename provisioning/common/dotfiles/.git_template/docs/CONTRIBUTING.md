# CONTRIBUTING.md

## 🫡 3 rules. don't break them

1. **everythng has a time and a place** - keep contributions in a pragmatic location
2. **commit clearly** - you can be silly, but don't be obtuse tomorrow
3. **before moving ANYTHING, grep for references** - silent failures suck worse than broken code

- **grep before u move anything** - see rule #3. seriously. do it.
- **Makefile is ur friend** - maintain, review, and leverage for frequent operations
- **Makefile is ur tool** - check `make help` and/or `make salt-help` for more
- **SUBMODULES** - do not `git add` blindly, submodules are documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `README.md`
