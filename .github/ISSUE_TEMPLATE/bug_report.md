## what broke

what happened vs what you expected

## how to reproduce

steps, salt commands, error output — whatever helps

## environment

- distro + version:
- salt version (`salt-call --version`):
- minion or master side?

## logs

```text
paste relevant salt logs here (salt-minion, salt-master, highstate output)
```

## anything else

pillar structure, custom states, what you already tried
