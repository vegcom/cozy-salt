# Code of Conduct

this is a cozy project. act accordingly.

## the vibe

- be kind. assume people are trying their best
- no gatekeeping. everyone was a beginner once
- respect that people have different setups, distros, and opinions about tabs vs spaces
- if someone's wrong, be helpful not smug about it

## contributing

- open issues, ask questions, propose ideas — all welcome
- if something's broken, a clear bug report is a gift
- if you fix something, explain why not just what
- disagreements about approach are fine. be chill about it

## security

found something? please report it privately via [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/vegcom/cozy-salt/security/advisories/new) — don't drop 0days in issues

## enforcement

this is a small project maintained by humans. if someone's being genuinely harmful, they'll be asked to leave. that's it. no 12-page escalation matrix.

*be excellent to each other* 🌿
